## LeBond: Connecting with Family through Shared Hobbies 

### by Jonathan King

Almost every family has something they like to bond over - some families love watching sports together, some families love to cook together, and some families love to watch TV shows together. However, as families get larger through the generations and children grow up and move to different places throughout the world, the distance keeps families from being able to bond over shared hobbies and activities as frequently. LeBond is a new app that seeks to address this by providing a digital app in which family members can still bond over their family hobbies. LeBond offers features such as post threads in which families can live chat or live react to events like sports games, short video feeds in which family members can share clips of them doing activities like cooking and hiking, tournament brackets in which families can organize tournaments for online activities like chess, and a "flex board" where family members can show off and celebrate the most proud accomplishments of their life (for example birthing a kid).
