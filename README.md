# Halo: an app for practicing gratitude together with family and friends
## Jonathan King | DH 110 | Spring 2023

### Introduction

Halo is a mobile app designed to encourage families (and friends) to practice gratitude in their everyday lives. Practicing gratitude is expressing what one is thankful for and counting one's blessings. Practicing gratitude together enables family members to lead happier lifestyles and keep in touch on what has been going on in each others' lives. Halo incentivizes users to practice gratitude daily through its app design and in-game store.

### Design statement

In a world where people are always moving around whether for work, school, or personal reasons, it can be hard for families to stay connected. This especially goes for extended families, where it can be hard to keep in touch with everyone, especially with the children growing up so fast. On a similar note, mental health is very important, and it is something that families may not feel comfortable talking about depending on how close they are. With these two things in mind, Halo is an app that aims to address the two problems by encouraging families to practice gratitude together, which will allow them to stay connected on what's happening in each others' lives while improving everyone's mental health.

### Competitor analysis [assignment01 & 02]: 

Halo is a unique app that combines the qualities of a social media app with that of a mindfulness / mental health app. Through my research, I found that there were no direct competitors. Thus, I decided to evaluate a social media app, BeReal, since it's social features are similar to what I hope to design for Halo. Similar to BeReal, I aim to design Halo to spontaneously prompt users to express gratitude at a random time everyday, and users can see, react, and comment on how family members and friends express gratitude. The other app I evaluated was Reflect, a daily journaling app that encourages users to reflect on their life through processing thoughts and emotions, leading to improved mental health. Similar to Reflect, I hope that Halo can be an app that improves users' mental health through reflection on what they are grateful for.

## LeBond: Connecting with Family through Shared Hobbies 

### by Jonathan King

Almost every family has something they like to bond over - some families love watching sports together, some families love to cook together, and some families love to watch TV shows together. However, as families get larger through the generations and children grow up and move to different places throughout the world, the distance keeps families from being able to bond over shared hobbies and activities as frequently. LeBond is a new app that seeks to address this by providing a digital app in which family members can still bond over their family hobbies. LeBond offers features such as post threads in which families can live chat or live react to events like sports games, short video feeds in which family members can share clips of them doing activities like cooking and hiking, tournament brackets in which families can organize tournaments for online activities like chess, and a "flex board" where family members can show off and celebrate the most proud accomplishments of their life (for example birthing a kid).
