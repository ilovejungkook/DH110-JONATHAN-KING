# Halo: an app for practicing gratitude together with family and friends
## Jonathan King | DH 110 | Spring 2023

### Introduction

Halo is a mobile app designed to encourage families (and friends) to practice gratitude in their everyday lives. Practicing gratitude is expressing what one is thankful for and counting one's blessings. Practicing gratitude together enables family members to lead happier lifestyles and keep in touch on what has been going on in each others' lives. Halo incentivizes users to practice gratitude daily through its app design and in-game store.

### Design statement

In a world where people are always moving around whether for work, school, or personal reasons, it can be hard for families to stay connected. This especially goes for extended families, where it can be hard to keep in touch with everyone, especially with the children growing up so fast. On a similar note, mental health is very important, and it is something that families may not feel comfortable talking about depending on how close they are. With these two things in mind, Halo is an app that aims to address the two problems by encouraging families to practice gratitude together, which will allow them to stay connected on what's happening in each others' lives while improving everyone's mental health.

### Competitor analysis

Halo is a unique app that combines the qualities of a social media app with that of a mindfulness / mental health app. Through my research, I found that there were no direct competitors. Thus, I decided to evaluate a social media app, [BeReal](https://bereal.com/en/), since it's social features are similar to what I hope to design for Halo. Similar to BeReal, I aim to design Halo to spontaneously prompt users to express gratitude at a random time everyday, and users can see, react, and comment on how family members and friends express gratitude. The other app I evaluated was [Reflect](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reflect-guided-daily-journal/id1443541171), a daily journaling app that encourages users to reflect on their life through processing thoughts and emotions, leading to improved mental health. Similar to Reflect, I hope that Halo can be an app that improves users' mental health through reflection on what they are grateful for.

To go about analyzing the competitor apps, I conducted [heuristic evaluation](https://github.com/ilovejungkook/DH110-JONATHAN-KING/blob/main/Assignments/Assignment01.md) and [usability testing](https://github.com/ilovejungkook/DH110-JONATHAN-KING/blob/main/Assignments/Assignment02.md). Please note that throughout the early stage of the design process, I pivoted my design idea from being a broad idea of connecting families through similar interests to a more specific idea of connecting families through practicing gratitude.

### User research

The next step of the design process was conducting user research. At this point, I decided to commit to designing an app for practicing gratitude. In order to go about conducting user research, I decided what the target users were for the app: family members who speak English and are active on social media apps. After deciding the target users, I prepared some general and specific questions about family and gratitude to ask students of different backgrounds and different proximity to their family.

### UX storytelling 

After gathering user research, it was important to focus on UX storytelling and really honing in on what the user personas were from the target users, as well as understanding their behaviors and actions. To do this, I developed two personas, Austin and Vera. Austin is a young college student who moved away for school and wants to stay in contact with family members, who are now further away. Vera is a grandmother who wants to be as involved in her grandchildren and childrens' lives as possible.

### Low-fidelity prototype 

After gathering all the information I needed and thinking through how to best design the app to appeal to users, it was finally time to start designing the app. I started with a low-fidelity prototype, which was a simply a sketch on my notes app of what I envisioned the app to look like. To see more of the low-fidelity prototype, please click [here](https://github.com/ilovejungkook/DH110-JONATHAN-KING/blob/main/Assignments/Assignment05.md).

### Interface design

Before designing the high-fidelity prototype, it was important to test design variations in colors, typography, and shape in order to get a sense of what design system would work best. [Here](https://github.com/ilovejungkook/DH110-JONATHAN-KING/blob/main/Assignments/Assignment06.md) is a summary of my findings. In addition, [here](https://www.figma.com/file/v5861YReyh9hdv9Y0mVrmK/halo-wireframe-%2F-wireflow?type=design&node-id=11-183&t=rLLhQrdV3kvY2aDx-0) is the design system with fonts and colors that I decided to proceed with.

### High-fidelity prototype

Finally, it was time to design a high-fidelity prototype for Halo. It was mainly a process of translating the low-fidelity sketch to Figma, while keeping in mind the feedback I received form the professor and classmates. Here are my [high-fidelity prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/v5861YReyh9hdv9Y0mVrmK/halo-wireframe-%2F-wireflow?type=design&node-id=31-980&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=31%3A980) and the [final wireframes](https://www.figma.com/file/v5861YReyh9hdv9Y0mVrmK/halo-wireframe-%2F-wireflow?type=design&node-id=34-1115&t=rLLhQrdV3kvY2aDx-0).

### Conclusion: 

Throughout the process of designing Halo, the most important lesson I learned is that the key to successful design is empathy and really understanding the users of the app. Through the various steps of the design process, there was always an emphasis on empathy, whether it was through user surveys, creating personas, or asking for feedback from peers. This is something I will keep in mind when designing anything in the future.

Additionally, I found it valuable to have the opportunity to learn Figma. I've always wanted to learn more about the app and about design, since it seems very fun. I'm thankful to have had the opportunity to learn Figma and for all the knowledge about UI / UX design. The course was valuable to me and gave me a great introduction into the field of UI / UX.
