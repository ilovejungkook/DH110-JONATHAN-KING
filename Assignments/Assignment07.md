# Assignment 7

## High Fidelity Prototype

My project is called "Halo", an app that encourages family members to express gratitude more often. Halo accomplishes this by prompting users to express gratitude at a random time everyday about something or someone they are thankful for. Besides the daily prompt, users can browse an extensive list of prompts on the app to express additional gratitude for people, events, and things in life in the past and in the present. The hope of Halo is to help family members keep in touch and share what is on their mind or what they find meaningful to each other. For the interactive prototype of the phase, I tried bringing some of Halo's proposed features to life. However, there are still many features to be prototyped.

## Tasks supported

1. The first task my prototype supports is sharing gratitude with family members.
2. The second task my prototype supports is commenting on gratitude shared by family members.

## Cognitive walkthrough

The only cognitive walkthrough I had was in class on Week 8 Thursday, 5/25/23, for the in-class cognitive walkthrough assignment. From the cognitive walkthrough session, some important things I learned were to add icons and that they could be found online, to make sure all buttons or items that look like they can be pressed lead to a page, and just being thorough in making sure all possible paths within the prototype are addressed. I felt like all the feedback was very valid as I had and still have a lot to prototype. I plan on keeping all of these things in mind as I work on making a throrough and complete version of the project prototype. Some things I plan on doing as I continue improving the prototype include adding all the other features I planned for the app (ex: store function, selecting prompts for expressing gratitude, adding friends / family members). I'm grateful to have classmates to look up to and learn from with this class.
