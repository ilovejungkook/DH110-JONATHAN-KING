# Assignment 5: Low-Fidelity Prototypes

## Project Description

**Purpose:** The purpose of the low-fidelity prototypes is to see if the vision I have for the app I want to design can be designed, and also to test how intuitive it would be for users to use the app.

**User Persona:** The user personas for this app encompasses a diverse range of people, since the design challenge is to connect family members. Thus, the target user demographic is for people of age twelve and up, people of all ethnicities and races, people with access to a technological device, and people who have families and want to be more connected to them. Because of the broadness of the user personas, the app needs to be easily navigable and appeal to a wide demographic (I believe practicing gratitude is something everyone can do and should do as it leads to better quality of life). 

**User Research:** From user research done in a previous assignment, I learned that people in the student demographic are grateful for their family members but may struggle with expressing it. Part of the purpose of this app is to make it easier and more natural for people to express gratitude to one another and for people to share about what they are grateful for. 

**Features & Tasks:**

1. The first and most key feature/task for this app is the button to express gratitude - each day when users open the app, they will be prompted to answer the question "what are you thankful for today?" After answering the question, users will be allowed to see what other users on the app that they are connected to (i.e. family members) have shared. The app's straightforward design and purpose allows users of various technological backgrounds to use it. 
2. The second task adds on to the first task and allows users to answer additional prompts. After sharing what they are thankful for for the day, users can browse a library of gratitude prompts and choose to answer questions like "what is one childhood memory that you are grateful for?" and "who is someone you are grateful to today?" Alternatively, users can also choose to share an additional answer to "what are you thankful for today?" A subfeature of this, which will not be shown in the wireframe at this time, is a roulette feature in which users can choose to answer a prompt randomly selected by the app. The purpose of this is to provide a workaround for people who may feel awkward in deliberately expressing gratitude to loved ones.
3. The third task is being able to add comments on family member's gratitude posts.
4. The fourth task is just an idea at this time and will not be implemented into the wireframes and wireflows. Nevertheless, this task's purpose is to encourage users to stay on the app. This is achieved through an in-game shop that users can access. The in-game shop partners with global companies in bringing rewards that users can obtain through in-game currency that is gained by expressing gratitude. Redeemable rewards include family vacations, restaurant gift cards, and amusement park tickets. Rewards are designed to encourage family bonding, and family members can combine their points together to redeem the rewards.

## Wireframes and Wireflows

### Wireframe

### Wireflow

The orange lines illustrate task 1 of expressing gratitude through posts. In the first screen, users are prompted to share their thoughts of gratitude for the day. After writing down their thoughts in screen 2, they share what they wrote in screen 3 and can scroll through to see what family members were thankful for. 

The green lines illustrate task 2 of answering additional gratitude prompts. This task starts in screen 3, where users can click on the button to "share more." From there, users are directed to screen 5 and have two options - choosing to answer a prompt or choosing to free write what they are additionally thankful for. If the former option is chosen, the user is directed to screen 6 and can scroll through a selection of prompts or search for keywords that lead to prompts that they want to express gratitude about. After a prompt is selected, or if the user chooses to free-write, the user is directed to screen 2 again to answer the prompt or free-write about it. After the written part, the user once again arrives at screen 3.

The yellow lines illustrate task 3 of commenting on family members' posts. This starts with the "comment" button option in screen 3. If users click on it, they will be directed to a full screen of the post they want to reply to in screen 4 and can type a comment. Users click "add comment" to send the comment or "back" if they end up deciding not to leave a comment. Both buttons will redirect back to screen 3.

## Wireflow Testing

Overall, the wireflow testing went fairly smoothly. For the first task, there were no difficulties in knowing how to make a post expressing gratitude on the app. However, the second task was a little confusing, as the tester didn't know where the "share more" button went to at first, and mistakenly thought that it may refer to screen 2. Nevertheless, after clarification, the tester arrived at screen 5. However, there was more confusion afterwards, as the user thought answering the prompts would have led to a more customized screen based on the prompts, rather than screen 2. This can be fixed with more screens in the wireframe in the future. The third task went relatively smoothly, except the tester was confused for where to go after the "add comment" button was clicked. My design can be improved in this regard with a screen that allows users to view their comment as well as all other comments. All in all, the tester could successfully complete all tasks, although the processes for tasks 2 and 3 could be improved and made more intuitive.

## Reflection

All things considered, it was a good experience testing with a low-fidelity prototype. The wireframe design process was fun and went smoothly, however the testing part was more confusing for the tester than I anticipated. Through this process, I learned that it is wise to test a low-fidelity prototype first before investing lots of time into creating a higher quality product. This is because many obvious flaws and user pain points can be detected with a low-fidelity prototype. I also learned that even though the prototype is low-fidelity, it is still important to put effort into the thought behind it in order to ensure that the tester understands it well. If I were to do this again, I would try to have more screens in the prototype to allow for a more intuitive experience for the tester, and to account for different ways they may interpret the screens. This is also what I would do to revise my low-fidelity prototype.
