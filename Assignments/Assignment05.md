# Assignment 5: Low-Fidelity Prototypes

## Project Description

**Purpose:** The purpose of the low-fidelity prototypes is to see if the vision I have for the app I want to design can be designed, and also to test how intuitive it would be for users to use the app.

**User Persona:** The user personas for this app encompasses a diverse range of people, since the design challenge is to connect family members. Thus, the target user demographic is for people of age twelve and up, people of all ethnicities and races, people with access to a technological device, and people who have families and want to be more connected to them. Because of the broadness of the user personas, the app needs to be easily navigable and appeal to a wide demographic (I believe practicing gratitude is something everyone can do and should do as it leads to better quality of life). 

**User Research:** From user research done in a previous assignment, I learned that people in the student demographic are grateful for their family members but may struggle with expressing it. Part of the purpose of this app is to make it easier and more natural for people to express gratitude to one another and for people to share about what they are grateful for. 

**Features & Tasks:**

1. The first and most key feature/task for this app is the button to express gratitude - each day when users open the app, they will be prompted to answer the question "what are you thankful for today?" After answering the question, users will be allowed to see what other users on the app that they are connected to (i.e. family members) have shared. The app's straightforward design and purpose allows users of various technological backgrounds to use it. 
2. The second task adds on to the first task and allows users to answer additional prompts. After sharing what they are thankful for for the day, users can browse a library of gratitude prompts and choose to answer questions like "what is one childhood memory that you are grateful for?" and "who is someone you are grateful to today?" Alternatively, users can also choose to share an additional answer to "what are you thankful for today?" A subfeature of this, which will not be shown in the wireframe at this time, is a roulette feature in which users can choose to answer a prompt randomly selected by the app. The purpose of this is to provide a workaround for people who may feel awkward in deliberately expressing gratitude to loved ones.
3. The third task is being able to add comments on family member's gratitude posts.
4. The fourth task is just an idea at this time and will not be implemented into the wireframes and wireflows. Nevertheless, this task's purpose is to encourage users to stay on the app. This is achieved through an in-game shop that users can access. The in-game shop partners with global companies in bringing rewards that users can obtain through in-game currency that is gained by expressing gratitude. Redeemable rewards include family vacations, restaurant gift cards, and amusement park tickets. Rewards are designed to encourage family bonding, and family members can combine their points together to redeem the rewards.
