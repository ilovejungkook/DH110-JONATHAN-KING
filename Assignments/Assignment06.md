# Assignment 6: Interface Design

Jonathan King | DH 110 | Spring 2023

## Project description

My project is an app called "thanksgiving" and it is designed to allow family members to have an easier time sharing about the things they are grateful for in everyday life, as well as how they are grateful for each other. In essence, "thanksgiving" is an app that encourages the practice of giving gratitude. The purpose of the interface design assignment is to better understand what typography, shapes, and colors are the most user-friendly with the ultimate intention of creating an app that will allow users to comfortably and easily express gratitude on the app.
