# Assignment #3 - Learning from People in Context

## Research Goal & Requirements

After the first couple of assignments, I am officially pivoting in the design challenge. Instead of connecting families through hobbies, my new goal is to connect family through gratitude and sharing things they are thankful for in everyday life. To achieve this goal, I hope to design an app that encourages practicing gratitude daily at random times. There aren't really any current apps that help achieve this goal besides mental health related apps that encourage healthy practices like reflection, meditation, and journaling on different topics. Thus, an app specifically dedicated to gratitude can help address the goal I have a lot. Some constraints to achieve this goal are getting multiple members of families on the app and making the app easily learnable and something that people enjoy going on and enjoy participating in. 

## Target Users

Target Users for this app are all kinda of family members. This target audience is diverse, as it encompasses people of all ages, races, ethnicities, and technological backgrounds. However, the target audience will be limited to English users in the United States for now. Ideally, the app will be mainstream to attract the most amount of people to practice gratitude often and together. People will use the app daily and either when they are feeling like practicing gratitude (either gratitude for events in life or for people, maybe even family members) or random times when the app gives them a notificatiion to practice gratitude. To complete the activity, users will open the app on their phone and either answer a prompt related to gratitude or express gratitude in the form of a post/note. 

## Research Method - Active Participatory Interaction

To gather research for the app, I plan on actively having a conversation/interview with participant(s). I believe active interaction is helpful in gauging peoples' thoughts on topics like family and gratitude. Although, if there was enough time, I also think it would be helpful to covertly or observe an environment like a classroom or workplace and see how people practice gratitude in their everyday interactions and conversations. 

## Research Plan

For the research, I plan on conducting a virtual interview/conversation with a group of three friends in different situations - one is working full time, one is a student living on campus, and one is a student living at home. I will have a list of questions prepared and will discuss the questions with the participants. It will be participatory involvement, and I plan on collecting data by taking notes on the discussion and maybe recording it if the participant is comfortable.

General Questions
- What are some things/people/events that you are grateful for?
- How often do you think about what you are grateful for?
- How often do you express to someone that you are grateful to them?
- How often do you talk with your family? What do you usually talk to them about? 

More in depth questions
- Are you satisfied with how frequent you practice gratitude? 
- How do you express appreciation for someone? 
- How do you think expressing gratitude affects your life?
- If you have a family, what are some things you are grateful for about them? Do they know you are grateful to them about these things?

## Reflection

Overall, I think the user research went well and definitely provided valuable insight for my app. I learned that there is a niche for the app I want to develop, since the people interviewed expressed that they don't always express gratitude as much as they would want, especially to family, or they may feel awkward or uncertain about how or when to express gratitude. The app I want to make can help address those pain points and make expressing gratitude something that is more frequent and normal. Additionally, the people interviewed mentioned that they mainly talk with family members about ongoing events in life. The app I want can support that by encouraging family members to talk about things they are grateful for in everyday life. Lastly, I learned from the interview about different ways people can express gratitude; besides words, gratitude can also be expressed through physical touch, spending time together, giving gifts, and doing things for someone. All in all, I am excited to implement what I learned from the user research into the final app.
