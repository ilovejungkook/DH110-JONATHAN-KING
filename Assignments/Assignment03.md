# Assignment #3 - Learning from People in Context

## Research Goal & Requirements

After the first couple of assignments, I am officially pivoting in the design challenge. Instead of connecting families through hobbies, my new goal is to connect family through gratitude and sharing things they are thankful for in everyday life. To achieve this goal, I hope to design an app that encourages practicing gratitude daily at random times. There aren't really any current apps that help achieve this goal besides mental health related apps that encourage healthy practices like reflection, meditation, and journaling on different topics. Thus, an app specifically dedicated to gratitude can help address the goal I have a lot. Some constraints to achieve this goal are getting multiple members of families on the app and making the app something that people enjoy going on and enjoy participating in.
