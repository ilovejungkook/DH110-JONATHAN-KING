# Assignment #2

## Usability Testing

### Introduction

The purpose of Usability Testing is to see how a website or app measures up in regards to the three metrics of usability of effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. These three metrics help measure the general user experience of the app or website. In this assignment, we will usability test the app ["Reflect."](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reflect-guided-daily-journal/id1443541171). "Reflect" is a journaling app that helps users process their thoughts and emotions, with a goal of improving mental health. Since the last assignment, I have decided to pivot from connecting families through hobbies to connecting families through gratitude and other positive mental health practices. This is because I feel like this new lens can have more impact, and also because I found that the previous idea can already be addressed with family group chats or social media. With this app, I specifically wanted to test the usability heuristics of #3 user control and freedom, #6 recognition rather than recall, and #7 flexibility and efficiency of use, since I believe those three qualities are important for a mental health app. These three heuristics will be tested through the three tasks in the usability test.

### Conclusion

Overall, the biggest lesson I learned through the usability test is that it is important not to generalize mental health concepts, or generalize how people may be feeling. Generalizing in this way can cause an app to not be as effective. Moving forward, in the app I want to design for the design challenge, I will be aware of this and make sure to make an app that is the right balance between general and specific (maybe something that has a broad scope but is effective in connecting families). Some things that went well with the usability test were that the tasks were achievable, the feedback was helpful, and the participant was able to navigate through the app well. Some things that did not go well were that there were spelling mistakes at times which is my fault, sometimes the tasks seemed long and tedious, and there could have been more variety in the tests. In the future, I hope to have more specific and diverse tasks in usability tests.
