# Connecting Families Through Shared Hobbies and Interests

## Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation

Jonathan King | DH 110 | Spring 2023

### About the project

Many families bond over shared hobbies and interests, whether that is playing sports together, cooking together, or even watching the latest episode of a TV show. However, as families grow larger through the generations and children grow up and move away, it becomes harder for families to bond over shared hobbies and interests due to the physical distance. 

To address this challenge in connecting families, I hope to design an app called LeBond (named after Lebron James, who is a great family guy). Some of the features I hope to incorporate in LeBond include threads where family members can live chat or live react to events like sports games and the newest episode of a TV show, short video feeds where family members can share clips of them doing activities like cooking and fishing, tournament brackets where families can organize tournaments for online activities like chess, and a "flex board" where family members can celebrate and show off the most happiest and proudest moments of life, such as a wedding proposal or welcoming a baby into the family.

In this assignment, we will take a look at two web apps that are similar to LeBond and see how well they adhere to the 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design. We will also provide Severity Ratings for Usability Problems with respect to the target audience of the apps.
