# Connecting Families Through Shared Hobbies and Interests

## Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation

Jonathan King | DH 110 | Spring 2023

### About the project

Many families bond over shared hobbies and interests, whether that is playing sports together, cooking together, or even watching the latest episode of a TV show. However, as families grow larger through the generations and children grow up and move away, it becomes harder for families to bond over shared hobbies and interests due to the physical distance. 

To address this challenge in connecting families, I hope to design an app called LeBond (named after Lebron James, who is a great family guy). Some of the features I hope to incorporate in LeBond include threads where family members can live chat or live react to events like sports games and the newest episode of a TV show, short video feeds where family members can share clips of them doing activities like cooking and fishing, tournament brackets where families can organize tournaments for online activities like chess, and a "flex board" where family members can celebrate and show off the most happiest and proudest moments of life, such as a wedding proposal or welcoming a baby into the family.

In this assignment, we will take a look at two web apps that are similar to LeBond and see how well they adhere to the [10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/). We will also provide [Severity Ratings for Usability Problems](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/) with respect to the target audience of the apps. 

### App 1: [Bleacher Report](https://bleacherreport.com/)

Bleacher Report is an all-in-one app for sports fans to keep up with the latest sports news, follow live scores from their favorite teams, and chat about sports events. Its home page has the top sports news, as well as scores from featured games at the top of the page. Its trending page has all the hottest sports news from the past few days across different sports. Its profile page allows the user to customize what kind of things they would like to see on the app, such as sports leagues, sports teams, and types of sports news. Its alerts page shows the alerts that it has sent the user based on the sports interests they have specified. Lastly, the scoreboard page shows scores of different matches across different sports leagues such as the NBA, NFL, and NHL. Bleacher Report's live chat feature is something that I hope to incorporate into LeBond - where family members can live chat about different events. I could not find any appropriate live chat alternatives online to look at for the heuristics evaluation because a lot of them may have good intentions, but people use them for non-school-appropriate purposes. 

Overall, Bleacher Report is a great app that is an all-in-one place for everything sports, which is something I admire. It is convenient to navigate and has many features a sports fan would desire in an app. I hope that LeBond can also be an all-in-one place for family members to share everything together. 

### App 2: [BeReal](https://bere.al/en)

BeReal is a new social media app where users are instructed to take a picture and selfie at a random time during the day to "be real." They can see their friends' pictures and selfies in their feed, and they can choose to react and/or comment on the pictures. It is a simple app that allows users to capture a moment of their everyday life. What I admire about BeReal is that it has a simple yet effective strategy to allow people to keep up with moments in their friends' everyday lives. Additionally, users have the option to "befake" by not posting at the specified time and posting later instead in order to capture a more social media worthy or meaningful moment. 

Overall, BeReal is a simple social media app that attracts users through its unique spin on sharing moments in life with friends. It is straightforward and doesn't require users to spend a lot of time on it. I hope to incorporate BeReal's method of capturing veryday moments into LeBond.

### Heuristic Evaluation of Bleacher Report and BeReal

| Heuristic | Bleacher Report | Rating for Bleacher Report | BeReal | Rating for BeReal |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Visibility of system status | The app is navigable and users can tell where they are on the app, as well as if the app is functioning | 0 | Generally, users can tell when the app is functioning. Sometimes there are errors in which users get a notification that a friend has posted, but it takes a while before the post shows up. | 2 |
| Match between system and the real world | The app uses navigation icons that are recognizable to most people that would be on the app. In addition, the language used in the app is catered towards people who would be interested in sports | 0 | The app uses icons and terms that users should understand and be able to navigate through | 0 |
| User control and freedom | It is possible to delete comments on the app and in its chat, but it is not possible to redo. The undo button is not super accessible. | 1 | It is possible to delete comment and posts, but the delete option is hard to find. Additionally, sometimes there are issues with deleting comments | 2 |
| Consistency and standards | The app is consistent with how many other apps function, however sometimes some adjusting may be necessary due to how the app specializes with sports | 1 | There is a learning curve with the app since it is different from other social media apps, but it is quickly learnable. | 1 |
| Error prevention | I rarely run into errors on this app, and when it happens there will be a notification that shows up and an option to report the issue | 1 | There are errors that happen on the app, but the app does not really communicate when these errors occur. For example, sometimes things will not load or things will take a while to post. | 2 |
| Recognition rather than recall | Buttons do not have labels, but should be understandable since they are commonly used icons. | 1 | Buttons do not have labels and definitely require users to remember the app to be able to use it well | 2 |
| Flexibility and efficiency of use | There are a wide variety of customization and personalization options that tailor the app experience to the user based on their preferences for teams and sports. However, there are no shortcuts that I am aware of, which could be cool to add. | 1 | There do not seem to be any accelerator or personalization/customization features besides custom reactions. However, there probably isn't much of a need for accelerator features in the app's current state. | 1 |
| Aesthetic and minimalistic design | The design is minimalistic and doesn't overwhelm the user. It is easy to tell what parts of the app are emphasized. Nevertheless, there is always room for improvement | 1 | The app is minimalistic and aesthetic, sometimes to the point where it is a little too minimalistic. | 1 |
| Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors | Error messages are clear and errors are addressed in a helpful way. | 0 | Error messages are understandable but not always helpful with the problems, and they don't appear all the time. | 2 |
| Help and documentation | I don't think there is a need for help and documentation for the app | 0 | I don't think there is a need for help and documentation for the app since it has very few features. | 0 |
