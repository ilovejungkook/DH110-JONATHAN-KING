# Assignment 4: Persona + Scenario

## The purpose of UX storytelling

- It helps communicate to the audience of the app in a way to help them see how the app can benefit them and how it fits their needs
- It helps identify users' problems and empathetically see things from their perspective in regards to the app
- It helps you understand your users better from their perspective on things
- It helps you focus on behaviors and motivations while filtering out things such as personal biases in designing the app
- Ultimately it helps you think through and understand users a lot better so you can design an app with the users' best interest in mind

For this assignment, I will try to do is to develop two user personas with empathy maps and two scenarios with journey maps. The personas will be doing one of the following two tasks: share with a family member that they are grateful for them and share a core memory with a family member. 

## Personas & Empathy Maps

### Persona 1: Tyler Harlow

## User Scenarios & Journey Maps

### Tyler's scenario: Share with a family member that he is grateful for them

On campus, Tyler is walking to class when he sees a family exploring the campus with their young children. Seeing this, Tyler is reminded of the times back when his parents took him to explore fun new places like parks, the aquarium, and the forest nearby his house. Tyler feels grateful to his family and wants to express it to them, but he is scared that it will come off as too out of the blue or out of character. Frustrated, Tyler ponders over what to do about this: he really wishes he can tell his family how he feels but it's been so long since he expressed gratitude to them that he becomes unsure of how they will take it.

Initiation: Tyler is reminded of his family and wants to express gratitude towards them.
Frustration: Tyler is unsure of how his parents will think if he randomly texts or calls them to express gratitude.
Solution: Tyler downloads the app I am trying to develop for the project. The app is designed for family members to add each other and randomly prompts users to share one thing they are grateful for at a random time everyday. Tyler convinces his whole family to get on the app, and he uses the app to share with his family about how he is grateful for them.
Resolution: Tyler and his family bond further with each other after validating one another with gratitude and affirmations. 

### Vera's scenario: Share a core memory with a family member

While out on a walk in the park one day, Vera recalls the moment where she found out she was pregnant with her first child. It was 32 years ago when the pregnancy result tests came in while she was walking the dog at the park. Vera quickly thinks about her youngest daughter, who recently became pregnant for the first time. Vera wishes to share with her youngest daughter about her experience, but doesn't know if it would be too abrupt to text or call her on the spot to tell her. 

Initiation: Vera is reminded about the time she found out she was pregnant, and wants to share that story with her youngest daughter, who is in a similar situation. Vera's intention is to assure and encourage her daughter.
Frustration: Vera is concerned if she seems too hands-on with her daughter, especially because she is a grown adult now. Vera has an inner conflict on how to best balance sharing experiences with her daughter while not coming off as too needy or controlling.
Solution: Vera learns about the app I am trying to develop for the project and convinces her family to get on it. The app has a feature where users are able to share stories from their life on their main profile page, and the stories are only visable to family members on the app. Vera shares about her first pregnancy experience on the app.
Resolution: Vera's youngest daughter sees this and the two are able to talk more and share life together, especially with this big moment in life.
